    "    * Showing the output on the sample data provided\n",
    "    * How concise it is (did you use a for loop when you could have used a comprehension for instance).  Simply put, try and write clean, concise and readable code (don't use 10 lines for what could have been done in 4).\n",
    "    * Even if the answer isn't perfect, make an honest attempt as partial credit will be given.\n",
    "* you should not have to explicitly use  a for loop except for question 12, meaning it is possible to complete the entire assignment without using the keyword \"for\".\n",
    "* the only third party functions/modules you are allowed to use are permutations and combinations from itertools.  yes, there is a built in median function in numpy, but the idea is to program yourself and solve the problems on your own using basic python techniques"
